/*! Position Control. Allows you to set an offset from your current
    location. The aircraft will move to that position and stay there.
    Typical use would be as a building block in an outer loop that does not
    require many fast changes, perhaps a few-waypoint trajectory. For smoother
    transition and response you should convert your trajectory to attitude
    setpoints and use attitude control or convert to velocity setpoints
    and use velocity control.
